# Saver - basic app for tracking your purchases

Hello there! I'm excited to present you my first real project that's helping me learn Swift and SwiftUI. It's going great and for now I'm having great fun experimenting with different features offered by the language.

## Requirements:
- because I'm using SwiftData to store information, iOS 17+ is required to use this app


## Current features:
- add your purchases, along with their value
- set your monthly budget and check how is it impacted by combined value of added purchases

## Planned features:
- saving provided data through multiple instances of the app
- saving goals
- saving tips that suggest how much money should you save after every purchase (for example after you make a purchase worth 53.49USD it will suggest 0.51USD/1.51USD/6.51USD)
- much more refined UI
